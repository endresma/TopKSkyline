/**
 * A cursor extends the interface {@link Iterator} by adding
 * functionality for opening and closing the cursor, i.e., reserving and
 * releasing of system resources, taking a look at the next element that would
 * be returned by call to <tt>next</tt>, updating elements of the underlying
 * data structure and traversing it another time without constructing a new
 * cursor.
 *
 * <p>Cursors <i>differ</i> from iterators in some points:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>open</tt>: before using a cursor the caller must open it in order
 *         to reserve resources, open files, etc.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>close</tt>: after using a cursor it must be closed by the caller
 *         in order to clean up resources, close files, etc.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>peek</tt>: cursors allow the caller to show the next element in
 *         the iteration without proceeding the iteration.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>supportsPeek</tt>: a method that returns <tt>true</tt> if an
 *         instance of a cursor supports the <tt>peek</tt> operation, otherwise
 *         it returns <tt>false</tt>.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>supportsRemove</tt>: a method that returns <tt>true</tt> if an
 *         instance of a cursor supports the <tt>remove</tt> operation, otherwise
 *         it returns <tt>false</tt>.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>update</tt>: cursors allow the caller to update the element in
 *         the iteration returned by the <tt>next</tt> or <tt>peek</tt> method
 *         and replacing it in the underlying collection.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>supportsUpdate</tt>: a method that returns <tt>true</tt> if an
 *         instance of a cursor supports the <tt>update</tt> operation,
 *         otherwise it returns <tt>false</tt>.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>reset</tt>: cursors allow the caller to traverse the underlying
 *         collection again without constructing a new cursor.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>supportsReset</tt>: a method that returns <tt>true</tt> if an
 *         instance of a cursor supports the <tt>reset</tt> operation,
 *         otherwise it returns <tt>false</tt>.
 *     </li>
 * </ul></p>
 *
 * <p><b>General contract:</b><br />
 * If an exception is thrown by a cursor consecutive calls to methods are not
 * guaranteed to produce correct results.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Important:</b> In order to guarantee a certain semantics, an implementation of a <tt>Cursor</tt>
 * has to ensure that a call of <tt>hasNext()</tt> always returns <tt>false</tt> after the first time
 * <tt>false</tt>
 * is delivered. Thus, it should not be possible to receive an element by calling <tt>hasNext()</tt>
 * and <tt>next()</tt> at a later point in time, if <tt>hasNext()</tt> returned <tt>false</tt>
 * before (even if the underlying data structure received a new element meanwhile).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>General order of method invocations:</b>
 * <pre>
 *     // creating a new instance of an arbitrary cursor
 *
 *     Cursor cursor = ...
 *
 *     // opening the cursor for first use
 *
 *     cursor.open();
 *
 *     // consuming the cursor in a loop; checking if there is a next element
 *
 *     while(cursor.hasNext()) {
 *
 *         ...
 *
 *         // taking a look at the next element, but do not remove it from the
 *         // underlying collection (optional)
 *
 *         Object peek = cursor.peek();
 *
 *         ...
 *
 *         // consuming the next element
 *
 *         Object next = cursor.next();
 *
 *         ...
 *
 *         // removing object 'next' from the underyling collection (optional)
 *
 *         cursor.remove();
 *
